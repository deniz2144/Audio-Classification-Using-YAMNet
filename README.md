# Audio Classification with YAMNet and TensorFlow Hub

This project demonstrates the use of the YAMNet model from TensorFlow Hub for classifying audio files. YAMNet is a deep learning model designed for identifying various sound events in audio recordings.

## Overview

The project involves loading an audio file, processing it with the YAMNet model, and classifying it into one of the predefined categories. It also includes functionality to play back the audio file after classification.

## Features

- **Audio File Processing:** Load and preprocess audio files for analysis.
- **Model Integration:** Use YAMNet, a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub, to classify audio events.
- **Classification Results:** Retrieve and display the classification results, including the most likely category.
- **Audio Playback:** Play back the audio file to review the content.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Hub
- NumPy
- Librosa
- Sounddevice

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Install the required Python libraries using pip.

3. **Configure File Paths:**  
   Update the file paths in the script to point to your audio files.

4. **Run the Script:**  
   Execute the script to perform audio classification and playback.

## Usage

To use the project, follow the setup instructions, then run the provided script. The script will classify the audio file using YAMNet and display the classification results. It will also play the audio file for your review.
