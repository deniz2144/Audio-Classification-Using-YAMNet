Audio Classification Using YAMNet
Overview
This project focuses on classifying audio files using the YAMNet model, a pre-trained audio classification model available on TensorFlow Hub. YAMNet is a deep neural network trained to recognize a wide variety of sounds, utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The model is capable of processing audio data to predict the presence of different sound classes.

Project Structure
Audio File Path: The project starts by specifying the path to the audio file that will be classified.
Audio Reading: The soundfile library is used to read the audio file, extracting the waveform and sample rate.
Model Loading: The YAMNet model is loaded from TensorFlow Hub.
Inference: The model processes the waveform to output scores, embeddings, and log-mel spectrograms.
Class Mapping: The project extracts the class labels from the model, which correspond to different sound categories.
Prediction: The model's output is analyzed to find the most likely sound class in the audio file.
Key Components
TensorFlow & TensorFlow Hub: Used for loading the YAMNet model and performing the inference.
SoundFile & SoundDevice: Utilized for audio file reading and playback.
Librosa: Provides functionalities for audio processing.
CSV: Used for reading the class labels from the model's class map file.
How It Works
Loading the Model: The YAMNet model is loaded using TensorFlow Hub. This model has been pre-trained on a large dataset of audio recordings.
Reading the Audio File: The audio file is read into a waveform array, and its sample rate is obtained.
Model Inference: The model processes the waveform to generate:
Scores: Probabilities for each class.
Embeddings: Feature representations of the audio.
Log-Mel Spectrogram: A time-frequency representation of the audio.
Class Mapping: The model provides a path to the class map, which is read to obtain the human-readable names of the classes.
Prediction: The class with the highest score is identified as the predicted sound class.
Playback: The audio file can be played back using the SoundDevice library.
